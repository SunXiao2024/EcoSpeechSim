# EcoSpeechSim: Multi-Scale Economic Simulation of Speech Recognition

## Introduction
The rapid advancements in **speech recognition technology** have profound economic implications, affecting labor markets, productivity, and macroeconomic stability. However, traditional economic models struggle to capture the **non-linear and dynamic interactions** between speech recognition systems and economic behaviors.

This project introduces **EcoSpeechSim**, a novel **multi-scale computational framework** that integrates:
- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** to simulate individual and organizational decision-making.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to optimize economic strategies.
- **Adaptive Market Simulations** to analyze speech recognition's economic effects across different scales.

By extending classical economic methodologies, our framework **overcomes equilibrium-based limitations**, enabling more **adaptive and scalable** simulations.

## Features
- **Multi-Scale Economic Modeling**: Simulates speech recognitionâ€™s effects at individual, firm, and macroeconomic levels.
- **Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Decision-Making**: Optimizes strategies in dynamic economic environments.
- **Adaptive Monte Carlo Sampling**: Improves forecast precision in economic impact analysis.
- **Parallelized Equilibrium Solver**: Enhances computational efficiency for large-scale simulations.
- **Interpretability & Scalability**: Provides actionable insights into labor shifts, productivity trends, and economic stability.
